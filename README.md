# Red Bull Website - 90s/2000s Retro


# Description

The goal of this project was to create a website for Red Bull that evokes the feel and design elements of the late 90s and early 2000s. The website focuses on showcasing events and athletes sponsored by Red Bull prior to 2002, as well as energy drinks available before that year. Through a retro aesthetic, we aim to transport visitors back to the time when Red Bull was solidifying its brand as a pioneer in extreme sports and energy drinks.

In line with this nostalgic theme, all elements, including events, athletes, and energy drink types, are specifically from before 2002. The design incorporates typical visual styles and features from that era, including bold colors, simple animations, and retro typography, creating an authentic 90s or early 2000s user experience. The goal is to honor Red Bullâ€™s legacy and its early impact on both the sports and energy drink industries.
